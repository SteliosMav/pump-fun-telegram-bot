## üõ† What‚Äôs a Volume Bot?

A **volume bot** is used to artificially increase trading activity for newly launched tokens on [Pump.fun](https://pump.fun), a Solana-based meme coin launchpad. By creating simulated buy/sell activity, these bots help:

- Boost token visibility on the Pump.fun trending and leaderboard sections.
- Create perceived momentum to attract real users or traders.
- Automate rapid transactions for marketing or liquidity stimulation.

This bot allows users to trigger these actions directly from **Telegram**, providing a simple and fast interface for volume boosting.

## üí∞ Service Fee

When executing transactions, the bot can take a small **service fee** to cover:

- Solana transaction costs.
- Bot infrastructure and uptime.
- A small margin for the operator.

> ‚ö†Ô∏è The service fee is deducted automatically from each executed transaction and is typically a small percentage of the total amount.
