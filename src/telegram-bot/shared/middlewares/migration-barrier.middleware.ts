EzPump launched as a fast, lightweight pump companion and quickly built a strong, active community. Now, its journey continues as part of the MicroPump ecosystem, where the core vision and experience will live on and grow even stronger.


*üíº   No action needed* ‚Äî all connected wallets have been securely transferred to MicroPump. Everything you had with EzPump is already waiting for you there.


*üôè   Thank you* to everyone who supported, used, and believed in EzPump. This evolution is part of the bigger picture and we're excited for what's next.`;
