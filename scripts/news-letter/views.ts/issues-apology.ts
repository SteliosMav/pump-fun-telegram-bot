Thank you so much for using our bot and being part of this amazing community. ðŸ™Œ

We've had some technical hiccups recently due to a sudden surge in users (you're all awesome for that!). We're in the process of addressing these issues and expanding our infrastructure to keep things running smoothly. Things are already improving, and we appreciate your patience while we fine-tune everything.

Sorry for any inconvenience caused! If you were impacted in any way, we're more than happy to make it right ðŸ˜Š. And since we just launched, *any helpful feedback would mean the world to us (and it'll be rewarded ðŸ˜‰)*. Just hit us up:
